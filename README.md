Seeed Studio Edgelab is an open-source project focused on embedded AI. We have optimized excellent algorithms from [OpenMMLab](https://github.com/open-mmlab) for real-world scenarios and made implemention more user-friendly, achieving faster and more accurate inference on embedded devices.

By using OpenMMLab framework combined with [MMCV](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv)(OpenMMLab foundational library for computer vision), you can easily use [MMClassification](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmclassification), [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection), [MMPose](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose) for image/ audio classification, object detection and pose estimation tasks.

Currently we support the following tasks:

- Object detection 
- Meter reading using landmark detection
- Audio classification

We will keep adding more tasks in the future. Stay tuned!
